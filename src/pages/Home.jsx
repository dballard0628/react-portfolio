                        Hi! I'm Danah, a 32-year-old aspiring software engineer from sunny Miami, Florida. I'm currently enrolled in a full stack web development bootcamp, where I am sharpening my skills in technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.

                        After years of exploring different career paths, I discovered my passion for coding and problem-solving. Whether it's building sleek front-end interfaces or designing efficient back-end systems, I love creating things that are both functional and meaningful.

                        My journey into tech has been fueled by curiosity, determination, and a deep desire to make an impact. As I continue to grow as a developer, I'm excited to collaborate on innovative projects, learn from industry professionals, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of web development.

                        When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring the local vinyl spots, diving into tech podcasts, or making good use of my Disney annual pass.

                        Letâ€™s build something great together! ðŸ’»ðŸŒ´
